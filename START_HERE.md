```bash
javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/com/bankapp/**/*.java
```

**Run Only**
```bash
java -cp bin com.bankapp.BankApplication
```

**Understand a Component**

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need an IDE?**  
A: No! Just command line + text editor. But IDEs like IntelliJ or Eclipse are helpful.

**Q: Where does data go?**  
A: Stays in RAM during execution. Lost when app closes. Use INSTALLATION.md for database setup.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**  
A: Educational code - production needs database, security enhancements, testing. But it's a great foundation!

**Q: Can I modify it?**  
A: Yes! That's the point. Following existing patterns will keep code clean.

**Q: Where do I ask questions?**  
A: Review the extensive comments in source code and documentation files.
